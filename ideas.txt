OVER-ARCHING GOALS:

- timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions
- runs in browser
- dynamically updated HTML and CSS (powered by JS)
- responsive user interface (adapts to different devices and screen sizes)
- questions and answers supplied by "Weekly wrap up" quiz in Module 3

PSEUDO-CODE:

âˆš create start button (HTML)
- create timer that counts down per 1000milliseconds from a set start time and stops at 0s
    - set time begins at 60s (15 questions = 4s per question)
    - add event listener to start button to begin timer on click AND call quiz function
- create bank of 15 questions (provided)
- create bank of 2-4 possible choices per question
- if response is correct, replace question with next question, print "correct" to HTML, and set internal counters for number of points earned
- if response is incorrect, timer loses 1s, replace question with next question, print "incorrect" to HTML
- if question bank has no more questions left, win condition
- if timer reaches 0, lose condition
- when win condition OR lose condition, user is prompted to input initials AND score is saved to local storage (extra: save time left to local storage)

VISUAL STRUCTURE:

- home page with title, instructions, start button, and "view high scores link"
- start changes page to have question as title and answers as buttons (highlight on hover, outline on click)
- correct response prints out "correct" on screen AND changes page to next question
- incorrect response prints out "wrong" on screen AND changes page to next question
- responding to final question ends at a final "finished" page with printed score on screen and textbox to input initials
- entering initials and clicking submit changes page to the high score Leaderboard that has "go back" and "clear scores" buttons
