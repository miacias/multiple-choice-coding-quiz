# multiple-choice-coding-quiz

## Description
 The motivation to building this online quiz was to provide a scaffold for future education-based web API projects. As an educator, I struggled to find resources that fit exactly the needs of my classroom, but in taking on this challenge, I will soon be able to build just the right classroom tools.

 I learned that JavaScript's ability to access a reference to HTML via the DOM is a fantastic resource for webpage interactivity. There are innumerable ways to design kinetically interactive pages, provided a little creativity.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections. 

 
 

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. 

 
 

## Features 

 
 

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. 

 
 

## How to Contribute 

 
 

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. 

 
 

## Tests 

 
 

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
