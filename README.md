## Description 

 The motivation to building this online quiz was to provide a scaffold for future education-based web API projects. As an educator, I struggled to find resources that fit exactly the needs of my classroom, but in taking on this challenge, I will soon be able to build just the right classroom tools.

 I learned that JavaScript's ability to access a reference to HTML via the DOM is a fantastic resource for webpage interactivity. There are innumerable ways to design kinetically interactive pages, provided a little creativity.


## Installation 

 N/A. [Deployed site here!](https://miacias.github.io/multiple-choice-coding-quiz/)
 

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. 

 
 

## Usage 

 
 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 

 
 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax: 

 
 

   ```md 

   ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png) 

   ``` 

 
 

## Credits 

 
 

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles. 

 
 

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. 

 
 

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well. 

 
 

## License 

 
 

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections. 

 
 

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time. 

 
 

## Features 

 
 

If your project has a lot of features, list them here. 

 
 

## How to Contribute 

 
 

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer. 

 
 

## Tests 

 
 

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
